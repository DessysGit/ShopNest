# ✅ All Fixes Applied - Final Summary

## 🎉 Issues Fixed Today

### 1. ✅ Cart Persistence Bug
**Problem:** Cart stayed the same when logging out or switching users

**Solution:**
- Updated cart to use user-specific localStorage keys (`cart_{userId}`)
- Guest users use `cart_guest`
- Cart clears on logout
- Cart initializes on login

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/store/cartStore.js`
- `frontend/src/store/authStore.js`

**Test:**
```
1. Login as User A, add items
2. Logout → Cart clears
3. Login as User B → Empty cart
4. Add different items
5. Logout and login as User A → See original cart
```

### 2. ✅ Homepage Role-Based Content
**Problem:** Homepage showed "Become a Seller" for all users

**Solution:**
- Homepage now personalizes based on user role
- Admins see "Go to Dashboard" → Admin Dashboard
- Sellers see "Go to Dashboard" → Seller Dashboard
- Buyers see "Go to Dashboard" → Products
- Only guests see "Become a Seller" CTA

**File Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`

**Test:**
```
1. Visit as guest → See "Become a Seller"
2. Login as buyer → See "Go to Dashboard" + "Browse Products"
3. Login as seller → See "Go to Dashboard" (personalized message)
4. Login as admin → See "Go to Dashboard" (personalized message)
```

**Problem:** Admin Categories page was empty

**Solution:**
- Built complete CRUD interface
- List all categories with cards

### 4. ✅ Order Model & APIs

- All relationships configured
- Enums for status tracking
- Pricing fields for commission tracking

**Files Created:**
- `backend/app/models/order.py`
- `backend/app/api/orders.py`

### 1. Stripe Payment Integration (High Priority)
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

**Backend Work:**
```bash
cd backend
pip install stripe
```

Create `backend/app/api/payments.py`:
```python
import stripe
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException
from app.config import settings

stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
router = APIRouter(prefix="/payments", tags=["Payments"])

@router.post("/create-intent")
async def create_payment_intent(amount: float, order_id: str):
    try:
        intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
            amount=int(amount * 100),  # Convert to cents
            currency="usd",
            metadata={"order_id": order_id}
        )
        return {"client_secret": intent.client_secret}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))

@router.post("/webhook")
async def stripe_webhook(request: Request, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    # Handle payment success
    # Update order payment_status to 'paid'
    pass
```

**Frontend Work:**
```bash
cd frontend

```

Update Checkout.jsx to integrate Stripe Elements
