## 💡 Pro Tips

### Testing the Orders API
```python
# If you get import errors, check:
1. Order model exists in app/models/order.py
2. OrderItem model exists
3. Models are imported in main.py or __init__.py

# If models don't exist, create them based on the schema in the blueprint
```

### Common Issues You Might Face
1. **ImportError for Order/OrderItem** → Create the models
2. **ValidationError** → Add Pydantic schemas
3. **ForeignKey errors** → Check database relationships
4. **CORS issues** → Already configured, should be fine
