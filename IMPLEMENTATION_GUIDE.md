- cancelled_reason (Text)
- notes (Text)
```

**order_items table:**
```sql
- status (ENUM: matching order status)
```

### API Endpoints to Implement

#### **Admin APIs**
```python
# backend/app/api/admin.py

@router.get("/sellers/all")
async def get_all_sellers(db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Get all sellers with their profiles and user info"""
    # Return sellers with status counts
    
@router.post("/sellers/{seller_id}/approval")
async def approve_reject_seller(
    seller_id: UUID,
    action: str,  # 'approve' or 'reject'
    rejection_reason: str = None,
    db: Session,
    current_user: User
):
    """Approve or reject seller application"""
    # Update approval_status, approval_date, approved_by
    # Send notification to seller
    
@router.put("/sellers/{seller_id}/suspend")
async def suspend_seller(seller_id: UUID, db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Suspend an approved seller"""
    
@router.put("/sellers/{seller_id}/reactivate")
async def reactivate_seller(seller_id: UUID, db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Reactivate a suspended seller"""
```

#### **Order APIs**
```python
# backend/app/api/orders.py

@router.post("/orders")
async def create_order(order_data: OrderCreate, db: Session, current_user: User):
    """
    Create new order
    1. Validate products and quantities
    2. Check inventory
    3. Calculate totals
    4. Create order and order_items
    5. Update product quantities
    6. Calculate platform fees and seller earnings
    7. Send notifications
    """
    
@router.get("/orders")
async def get_user_orders(db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Get all orders for current user with items and product details"""
    
@router.get("/orders/{order_id}")
async def get_order_detail(order_id: UUID, db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Get detailed order information"""
    
@router.put("/orders/{order_id}/cancel")
async def cancel_order(
    order_id: UUID,
    reason: str,
    db: Session,
    current_user: User
):
    """Cancel an order (only if pending or confirmed)"""
    # Update status, cancelled_at, cancelled_reason
    # Restore inventory
    # Send notifications
```

#### **Seller Order APIs**
```python
# backend/app/api/sellers.py

@router.get("/sellers/orders")
async def get_seller_orders(db: Session, current_user: User):
    """Get all order items for seller's products"""
    # Join order_items with orders, products, and buyers
    
@router.put("/sellers/orders/{order_item_id}/status")
async def update_order_status(
    order_item_id: UUID,
    status: str,
    tracking_number: str = None,
    db: Session,
    current_user: User
):
    """
    Update order item status
    1. Validate status transition
    2. Update order_item.status
    3. Update order.tracking_number if provided
    4. Update main order.status if all items same status
    5. Send notification to buyer
    """
```

## ðŸ’¡ Important Business Logic

### Order Creation Flow
```python
def create_order(order_data, user, db):
    # 1. Start transaction
    # 2. Validate all products exist and are active
    # 3. Check inventory for each product
    # 4. Calculate subtotals
    # 5. Calculate platform fees (8-10% per item)
    # 6. Calculate seller earnings
    # 7. Create order record
    # 8. Create order_items for each product
    # 9. Decrement product quantities
    # 10. Create notifications for sellers
    # 11. Commit transaction
    # 12. Return order with all details
```

### Seller Earnings Calculation
```python
# For each order item:
subtotal = price * quantity
platform_fee = subtotal * (commission_rate / 100)
seller_earning = subtotal - platform_fee

# Store in order_items table:
order_item.subtotal = subtotal
order_item.platform_fee = platform_fee
order_item.seller_earning = seller_earning
```

### Order Status Transitions
```python
VALID_TRANSITIONS = {
    'pending': ['confirmed', 'cancelled'],
    'confirmed': ['processing', 'cancelled'],
    'processing': ['shipped', 'cancelled'],
    'shipped': ['delivered'],
    'delivered': ['refunded'],  # After dispute
    'cancelled': [],  # Final state
    'refunded': []    # Final state
}
```
