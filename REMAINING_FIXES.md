# 🔧 Remaining Issues & Fixes

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Cart Persistence Across Users ✅
**Problem:** Cart stays the same when logging out/switching accounts

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `cartStore.js` to use user-specific localStorage keys
- Format: `cart_{userId}` for logged-in users, `cart_guest` for guests
- Updated `authStore.js` to clear cart on logout and initialize on login

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/store/cartStore.js`
- `frontend/src/store/authStore.js`

### 2. Homepage Shows "Become Seller" for All Roles ✅
**Problem:** Homepage shows seller CTA even for admins and sellers

**Fix Applied:**
- Homepage now shows personalized content based on user role
- Admins/Sellers see "Go to Dashboard" button
- "Become a Seller" CTA only shows for guests
- Welcome message personalized by role

**File Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`

## ⏳ Still Need Implementation

### 3. Admin Categories Management UI
**Status:** Page exists but empty

**What's Needed:**
Create full CRUD interface in `frontend/src/pages/admin/Categories.jsx`

**Features to Add:**
- List all categories with icons
- Create new category with form
- Edit category details
- Delete category (with confirmation)
- Parent category selection (for subcategories)
- Icon/image upload
- Active/inactive toggle
- Slug auto-generation

**Backend APIs Available:**
- `GET /api/categories` - List all
- `POST /api/admin/categories` - Create
- `PUT /api/admin/categories/:id` - Update
- `DELETE /api/admin/categories/:id` - Delete

### 4. Payment Integration (Stripe)
**Status:** Not started

**What's Needed:**

**Backend (`backend/app/api/payments.py`):**
```python
import stripe
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter(prefix="/payments", tags=["Payments"])

@router.post("/create-intent")
async def create_payment_intent(amount: float):
    """Create Stripe payment intent"""
    intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
        amount=int(amount * 100),  # Convert to cents
        currency="usd",
        automatic_payment_methods={"enabled": True}
    )
    return {"client_secret": intent.client_secret}

@router.post("/webhook")
async def stripe_webhook(request: Request):
    """Handle Stripe webhooks"""
    # Verify webhook signature
    # Update order payment status
    pass
```

**Frontend Changes:**
1. Install packages:
```bash
npm install @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
```

2. Update Checkout.jsx to use Stripe Elements
3. Handle payment confirmation
4. Update order payment status
